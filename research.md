Differential molecular profiles in disease 


### Biomarker Discovery
Biomarker discoveryMy research is to use omice data and identify biomarker associated with disease progression as well as prognostic biomarker. PI3K in GBM; a panel of xx marker associated with NSCLS (cancer research). Clearance of somatic mutation at CR, particularly in nonpreleukemic genes, was associated with significantly better survival and less risk of relapse
Genetic alterationMy research focuses on the files of bioinformatics to analyze DNA and RNA sequencing. Specially, studying rare variant in to identify rare variant causing
