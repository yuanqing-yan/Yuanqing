### Molecular Biomarker Discovery
Biomarker facilitates the disease early detection, therapeutic intervention assessment and health outcome prediction. Through multiple genomics/proteomics platforms, Dr. Yan has identified favorable prognotic effect of PI3K alterations in IDH-WT GBM(Yan. et al., JCOPO,2020), a panel of 9 autoantibodies for NSCLC early diagnosis(Yan. et al., Cancer Research, 2019) and revealed complete mutation clearance associated with better survival outcomes in AML(Morita. et al., JCO, 2018). He has a specific interest in uncovering genomic profile alterations in brain aneurysm, stroke and brain tumor.

### Genetics in Brain Vascular Disease
Utilizing DNA sequencing data from familial pedigree samples, Dr. Yan studies the genetic linkage and disease-causing rare variants in brain aneurysm. An association of rare variants with the disease phenotype is also under investigation from the sporadic samples to obtain the higher mapping resolution of the diseaes locus. Integration of the DNA and RNA sequencing, differential molecular networks are being investigated.
